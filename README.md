I personaly use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) so instruction will be for VSCode. If you already have SFML installed and connected to another IDE/Code Redactor, you can only download /src folder (i hope).

**Instruction is for WINDOWS**

#Instalation
1. Download & Extract [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.5.1-windows-gcc-7.3.0-mingw-32-bit.zip) to C:/SFML-2.5.1/ 
2. Download & Extract [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/7.3.0/threads-posix/dwarf/i686-7.3.0-release-posix-dwarf-rt_v5-rev0.7z/download) to C:/mingw32/ 
3. Clone this repo to your machine.
4. Download & Install Visual Studio Code if you don't already have it.
5. Open cloned folder with VSCode.
6. Install the official C/C++ Extension, reload the window & wait for the dependencies to install.
7. At this point you should be able to run a build task Ctrl+Shift+B > Build & Run:Debug
